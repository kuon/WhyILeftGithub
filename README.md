# WhyILeftGithub

On October 25 2020 I made the decision to leave Github. I have worried about Github approach on privacy and freedom for some times, and the [youtube-dl drama][1] convinced me to find a solution.

A few reason why I cannot trust Microsoft:

- Microsoft won the JEDI contract, a $10b surveillance contract with the pentagon.
- Microsoft will sell cloud products to numerous intelligence agencies.
- Github have been over enforcing DCMA by taking down source code (youtube-dl is not the first).

I'm an open source developer, and I believe in freedom and human rights in general, and I cannot support a company that is making absurds amount of money on surveillance and human rights abuses. I'm against DRM, software patents, obfuscation, dark patterns, vendor lock in, planned obsolescence and all sorts of similar dark technical behavior.

I am also against copyright laws in their current form while I think all content creators deserve a fair compensation for their work.

My github account will stay active, and I will continue to participate on github as usual, but all my repositories have been moved away from github.
